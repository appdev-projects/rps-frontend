To enable autoformatting for .rb and .html.erb files:

 1. In the Cloud9 menu, select Open Your Init Script and add the following code:

        services.pluginManager.loadPackage([
          "~/.c9/plugins/formatruby/package.json",
          "~/.c9/plugins/formathtmlerb/package.json",
        ]);

    (if it's not already there).

 2. In the Cloud9 menu, select Preferences > Plugin Explorer and check "formathtmlerb" and
    "formatruby". You might need to do this each time you open the workspace.

You should then be able to autoindent with Cmd-Shift-B (Mac) or Ctrl-Shift-B
(Windows).

Hi! It looks like you've run bin/setup more than once for this project. That's unusual; are you sure that's what you want to do?

* Maybe you're trying to reset the dummy data in your development database;
  if so, try

  rails dev:prime

  instead.

* Maybe you're trying to enable autoformatting for .rb and .html.erb files. If so,

  1. In the Cloud9 menu, select "Open Your Init Script" and add the following code:

    services.pluginManager.loadPackage([
    "/.c9/plugins/formatruby/package.json",
    "/.c9/plugins/formathtmlerb/package.json",
    ]);

    (if it's not already there).

  2. In the Cloud9 menu, select "Preferences > Plugin Explorer" and check "formathtmlerb" and "formatruby".
